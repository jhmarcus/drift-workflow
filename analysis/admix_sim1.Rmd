```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>",
                      fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4)
```

```{r load.pkgs}
suppressMessages({
  library(flashier)
  library(drift.alpha)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(reshape2)
  library(tidyverse)
})
```

I want to do a series of simulations to see whether `driftr` can handle very simple admixture events. I start with the simplest event I could imagine: allow two populations to drift until time $t$, admix them in equal proportions (still at time $t$), and then terminate immediately. Means for Populations 1 and 3 (the non-admixed populations) will be independent, while means for Population 2 will simply be averaged from the means for Populations 1 and 3:

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.height = 400, out.width = 400}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/admix_fig1.png")
```

The covariance matrix appears as follows:

```{r sim}
set.seed(666)
simple.admix <- admix_graph_sim(n_per_pop = 20, p = 500)
plot_cov(simple.admix$CovMat, as.is = TRUE)
```

## Flash: greedy

Even in this simple case, greedy `flash` does not do well. It appears more as if Populations 1 and 3 split off from a main trunk and less as if a subsequent admixture event generated Population 2.

```{r fl.g}
Y <- simple.admix$Y
fl.greed <- flash.init(Y) %>%
  flash.add.greedy(Kmax = 20, prior.family = c(prior.bimodal(), prior.normal()), tol = 1)

labs <- rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 20)
plot_loadings(fl.greed$flash.fit$EF[[1]], labs)
plot_cov(fl.greed$flash.fit$EF[[1]])
```

## Flash: backfit

Backfitting doesn't solve the problem:

```{r fl.b}
fl.bf <- fl.greed %>% flash.backfit(maxiter = 30)
plot_loadings(fl.bf$flash.fit$EF[[1]], labs)
plot_cov(fl.bf$flash.fit$EF[[1]])
```

## Drift: $k$ correctly specified

When it's initialized to a tree with two leaves, `driftr` finds the correct solution:

```{r drift.2}
drift.res <- init_using_hclust(simple.admix$Y, k = 2) %>%
  drift(miniter = 2, maxiter = 30)
plot_loadings(drift.res$EL, labs)
plot_cov(drift.res$EL)
```

## Drift: $k$ over-specified

Finally, I over-specify $k$ by initializing to a three-leaf tree. The results incorrectly suggest that Population 3 split from 1 and 2 first, and then Populations 1 and 2 diverged. Note, however, that the ELBO is quite a bit lower than the ELBO of the `driftr` solution initialized using the correct $k$:

```{r drift.3}
drift.res <- init_using_hclust(simple.admix$Y, k = 3) %>%
  drift(miniter = 2, maxiter = 30)
plot_loadings(drift.res$EL, labs)
plot_cov(drift.res$EL)
```
