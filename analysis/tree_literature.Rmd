This note serves to collect papers and ideas that we've discussed as a group.

Ways to do FA:

* Drift
* Straight-up flash on a covariance matrix
* Flash as a penalized approach, constraining `L = F` (cf. Youngseok's work on `mr.ash`)
* A "greedy" version of drift: update $q(f_k | f_{-k})$ and $q(l_k)$ iteratively, keeping $q(f_{-k})$ and $q(l_{-k})$ fixed

To get trees:

* Flash with three-pointmass priors
* Spectral clustering
* Peter's "minimax" projection
* MILP techniques
